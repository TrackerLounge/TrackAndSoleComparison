# Description

I experimented with an image of a track and an image of a shoe sole to see if I could match the track to the shoe sole. I tried a number of pre-processing steps to make the image of the track and shoe sole look as similar as possible (e.g. ImageJ bandpass filter, make binary, edge detection, etc.). In the experiment, I did not know what bandpass filter settings were best, so I automated the process to generated many versions of the images by varying the values. I compare resulting images using SURF. The experiment was a failure.

Note: this is not production quality code. It was written in haste to quickly experiment. It has not been optimized. It is ugly rough-cut code.

# Library Requirements

In order to run this code, you will need to:
* build opencv locally and include the result in build path. 
    * See https://github.com/TrackerLounge/OpenCVSURF/blob/master/CompilingOpenCV/CompilingOpenCV.md
* download imageJ and add the ij.jar to the build path. 
    * See https://youtu.be/xc3syeTIv-k
